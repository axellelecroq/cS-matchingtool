# correspSearch matching tool
Currently under development, this project is part of my internship at the BBAW in the project ["Travelling Humboldt â€“ Science on the Move"](https://edition-humboldt.de/). 

The aim is to develop a tool to match one or several letters with letters already edited and available on [correspSearch](https://correspsearch.net/). The matched letters can be downloaded in CMIF format.
